Dear Frances;
I'm sure you will
be interested in hearing
about our preparations
for Christmas Rachael,
our severed household
eritie, informed us one
evening that the curtains
should he washed before
Christmas, so yesterday
mother proceeded to launder
them with greatest care, in
hopes of pleasing our Rachael
and improving the house for
the halidaye This morning
we carefully ironed them all,
six pairs, and, though they
are not of the finest quality
