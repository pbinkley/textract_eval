Dear Frances
were getting off at Past. Leaving
here tomorrow- arrive Now York Wednesday
A.M.-fairly early I'll taxi us up and we'll
get to your house between ft 9. Train gets
in at 7:30- I suspect Georgia will be howling for
breakfast by that time- So will delay for thel - unless
we can manage to feed her on the train.
We seem fated not to see your boys. Didn't
they like Lincoln? Till then-Cheerio.
Mollie
