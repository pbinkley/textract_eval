Dear Bob & Frances,
This is a perfunctory note
with the important news that I'm well and
hope you are, Christmas or not. I do wish
I were in Cleveland, though. Haven't even
ever seen Robert, jr. yet! I'll probably
go north after new years - would like to
meet two family again.
Have you seen my book in any
Cleveland book-store? - I don't suppose the poor 
thing will make expences for the publisher. I haven't
got hold of your "Responsible Drinking" yet, but must
do so soon. I hope Farrar & Rinehart sent you a
copy of Midsummernight, as J. Farrar promised. He was
ill for two months this fall, and all that business went on the
bum, but I hope they sent you a copy, even though late. Thanks
for the Indian youth incident, Bob.
My love to all of you.
Carl
