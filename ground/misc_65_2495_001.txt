20 April, 1933
My dear Miss Young:
Professor James T. Shotwell
is writing to you to explain a
proposed survey of the records of
the Inquiry and the American
Peace Delegation with a
view to a possible documentary
history of the work of the delegates.
This leads me to inquire
whether I may call upon
you at some time convenient
to you to learn what papers
Professor Young may have
