Friday the 13th.
Dearest Darling:-
Got your sweet letter
today - sure was sorry you
weren't here these last few
days- feel pretty well today
tho'. Back slided yesterday
with another beastly headache.
Am quite OKe now though -
just a matter of losing
this cough.
Been reading that book
you gave me today - starts
very well but I don't think
