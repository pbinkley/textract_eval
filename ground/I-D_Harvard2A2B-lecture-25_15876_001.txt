Permanent Revolution Lost causes
Free Trade
Differences in ideas, not fact
Russia not ready for Socialism
a) Rural, not industrial, had to make
factories
b) Private ownership, not corporate,
had to make trusts
c) Hand worker idealized as production
technique transfers importance
from skilled labor to engineer &
semi-skilled labor. (Hammer &
sickle)
