Dear Frances
We're getting off at last. Leaving
here tomorrow- arrive New York Wednesday
A.M.- fairly early. I'll taxi us up and we'll
get to your house between 8 + 9. Train gets
in at 7:30- I suspect Georgia will be howling for
breakfast by that time- So we'll delay for that - unless
we can manage to feed her on the train.
We seem fated not to see your boys. Didn't
they like Lincoln? Till then- Cheerio.
Mollie
