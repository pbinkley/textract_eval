Sunday Evening.
Dear Frances,
All summer I've been want-
ing to go Bear Mt. on the boat. To-
day I conceived the idea of going on
Tuesday, 11th, I'm asking the other
girls who were at my luncheon
party whether they wouldn't care
to go along. Aurelia Hull will go.
Hope you can too. The boat will
stop running on the 15th. It leaves
Desbrosses St. about 10 o'c. A.M. I
think. Fare round trip about
