Stoney Point
c/o Mrs. Charles W. McCandlass
New York
Tuesday evening
Dear Mrs. Binkley:
Your nice letter, telling all
the interesting news about your show
just  reached me. I am so sorry I
shan't be back in New York before
you are to leave - I should have
liked so much to see your things
and hear about what you are
doing in detail. Perhaps you will
be back again and you must let
me know. Good luck to your
show!
Very sincerely your
Clemons Robinson
