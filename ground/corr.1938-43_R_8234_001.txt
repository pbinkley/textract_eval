Dear Frances Binkley + Family
I was very much pleased
to get your cards. I knew you were in Colorado,
but I did not know just where. It is strange
that Boulder happens to be a place that is very
familiar to my husbands family. In fact
Bob's cousin teaches in Boulder, and I
hope you will come in touch with him. His
name is Christ Recht. I hope you will
introduce your self and tell him that you
were our neighbor. He happens to be one of my
husbands favorite cousins, they have
fished many times around your place and
been all ow around through those
mountains many times.
I suppose Bob and Tommy are quite
pleased to know that Donny and and Jerry McCombs
are going to live in their house play
in their yard.
I have not been over to school quite as much
