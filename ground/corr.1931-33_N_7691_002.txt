five ships to Buenes Ares and one
to an actress wife and "it must look
just like Wallace Berrys ship". So we
have hopes, and Jims ten dollars is
safe inline savings account, much as
he wanted to "puta ina nimmies benk".
He is a regular little "ilky". This A.M. I
was fixing a deposit slip for Jacks water
district, I went out to answer the door +
when l came back he who putting the
money into his bank as fast as he could
he put over three dollars in + it is one
of those Bank of Italy banks - He always
runs to his Dady + asks for "moony' or
'pemmy' he puts his palms out + shakes
them back + forth, if there arn't any he
puts his hands out and shrugs his
sholders, 'moony aw gone.' There is some
Jew on his Grammamas side - Jew -
German + Russian + Swede. He talks
German to his "Grossie" + sang Tannenbaum
at xmas and saya "beon scoll dean scoll
allawaya wigle scoll" with his grossbabu
(that is what it sounds like to me)
