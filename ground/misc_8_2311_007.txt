I can then send a copy on to
Usher, and I might perhaps be
able to work the other copy up into
an article for some periodical.
The stamps on this envelope are
intended for Bynx. Another letter,
to Frances, will complete his holdings
of the special issues for the the royal
visit. I have not seen the King
and Queen themselves. But I have
seen the royal train go past, with
the King and Queen concealed inside.
The train itself was a most beautf
beautiful spectacle in blue and
silver, and I shall never forget
the breadth of the smiles on the
faces of the fireman and the trainman.
I feel quite sure that the further
end of the fireman's smile stuck
out on the other side of the cab.
