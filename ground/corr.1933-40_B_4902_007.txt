the Renaissance gracefulness, which one finds
in certain of its monuments. Among its great
men, Florence counts Dante, the Medicis
Machiavelli, Benvenuto Cellini, and the fathers
of Petrarch, Leonardo de Vinci, and Michel Angelio.
Of course, to fully appreciate it, one should be
familiar with Italian history, (I've almost
forgotten "Roman Civilization" Elmore) and history
of art. (never took any courses upon this subject.)
I'm reading up on Florentine history, as I said,
and of course I study the guide book, but fear 
that the enjoyment I get is more of the pagan
variety - their pleasure at the contemplation
of beauty - and not the more subtle, erudite
joy, which not only sees, but understands.
If we were going to be here longer, I should
try to remedy my shortcomings, but
with only two weeks left, I feel it of little use
to do more than see all the beautiful things
I can and enjoy them to the utmost,
with the hope that if I do study art, some
time in the future, I shall remember having
seen the masterpieces whose history I am
learning. Of course one can always secure guides,
but my objections to them are numerous. First
of all, they usually speak miserable English,
secondly, they don't know their subject, except
in a most general, superficial way, and
thirdly, I'd rather look at a thing and
use my own imagination than have my
reverie shattered by cold facts pronounced
at the inopportune moment. I admit there
may be guides of the perfect variety, but
have not found any as yet.
