Friday
Dear Frances
am enclosing a letter
of Tommy's - It says 'I am
going in the water today' my
lizard and frog are happy
now cause I let them go
out in the grass where it is cool.
Do you know how hot it
is here - we like it better than
cold - the little pictures are
of himself and Joan when
they came out of the Water - we
eat down at the pier some-
times - all the boats have
gone away now - The old
pier has been taken away
