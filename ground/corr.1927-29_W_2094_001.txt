Saturday, Nov. 10.
Dear Frances & Bob,
We are begining to wonder whether you
returned safely from your canoeing Trip. We
thought of you often & wished we could have joined
you.
By this time we are all under harness
again and vactions seem in the dim, dim
past. I'm chafing considerably under my harness.
I get so discouraged because it takes my me so
long to do my housework, that I seldom get to 
do anything else. I'll have to improve my schedule!
Of course, I'll admit, the first weeks I had a
lot of painting & staining to do and you know all
about that.
You would have laughed had you heard 
Oswald complain about the weather all of September.
After all his bragging about this wonderful land
of Tucson he was miserable when he first got back. 
For a full month we had hot weather & no fooling.
Even native Tucronians complained. It was
doubly hard to work in such heat, & the teachers
felt there was no use trying to get any work
out of the the students. However for the past
month the weather has been almost so ideal. 
cold nights but the days real warm. So far we
have needed no little heat except what the sun gave
us. We have had but two small fires in the
fire place, so hope our fuel bill will be small.
