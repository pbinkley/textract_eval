into it something substantial and get the
interest of your students, it will be a
genuine achievement. Sticking your letter
away, I came upon your article and read
it through again. I like it just as well
as ever. Had a letter from McManis (do
you remember him?) a few day ago,
breathing indignation over Elliott's new book
on the Pragmatic Revolt Politics. I'm
just reading it, and find it hard going.
He always makes me feel like a half-
educated barbarian. I told him this summer
I always had to read him with dictionary
at my elbow, and don't think he liked it:
but I am certain a lot of these Oxford-
trained men keep a Greek thesaurus at elbow
when writing. Please give my affectionate
regards to Mrs. Binkley. We frequently
think of you here, and hope to see you
soon again.
Faithfully yours
Robert T. Crane
