get very far, judged by real
photographic standards !
I have wished since the first
time J saw him that you could
see a little old man who has
joined our cluel and Tru club.
We think - and so does Mr. mihalik-
that his face would be wonderful
to photograph. His a frail-
looking virionary type who years
ago foresaw the purpose of
mitropolitan parks for Churland.
Heris my clipping about him -
when I saw this I wrote and
asked him to join the Tree
Club !
Our regards to you and your
husband -
mabel meaker.
