the sudden and of his career a matter of
much more than personal concern.
9 do not suppose that we cantr of
service to you here, cut if we can 9 hope
that you will call upon us.
It is more than ever a satisfaction
to us now that we named our boy after
Bob; we can my hope that he will in
some measure deserve his name by
his qualities.
most sincerely yours
